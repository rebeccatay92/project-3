* Feature driven development approach was utilised throughout the project. This increased efficiency; the clean delegation ensured members were clear on their roles and reduced difficulties during merging of files.

* Other techniques in the AGILE development such as pair programming and daily scrums were used.

* Trello was utilised to keep track of tasks and assist in project management.
